## üî≠ Some of Ayan's work include:
1. [Ardour](https://ardour.org/): A libre Digital Audio Workstation (DAW),
   maintained by a diverse community ofdevelopers. Collaborated to optimize
   Ardour‚Äôs mix engine for Intel/AMD CPU with SSE, AVX, AVX512, and FMA
   extension. Also, optimized for ARMv8 and ARMv7 CPU with NEON extension.
   [[commits]](https://github.com/search?p=1&q=repo%3AArdour%2FArdour+author%3Aashafq&type=Commits)
   
2. [GNU Compiler Collection, GCC](https://gcc.gnu.org/): Contributed to ARM and AArch64 enhancements, including intrinsic optimizations in arm_acle.h.

3. [A57eq.lv2](https://github.com/ashafq/a5eq.lv2/): This an open-source LV2
   plugin featuring a high-performance 5-band equalizer, including a Low Shelf,
   three Peaking filters, and a High Shelf. Designed to assist both amateur and
   professional audio engineers, it supports precise sound sculpting across
   diverse tasks such as studio production, mastering, and live sound tweaking.

    What sets this equalizer apart is its meticulous core optimization. Leveraging
    Intel AVX2/FMA and SSE2 extensions (thoroughly tested on Intel‚Äôs 12th
    Generation Alder Lake) and NEON for ARM64/Aarch64 (tested on Apple M1), it
    delivers seamless and efficient performance. These optimizations achieve a 30%
    speed improvement over standard portable C++ code, translating to reduced power
    usage while maintaining superior audio quality.
   
4. [GuitarFx](https://github.com/ashafq/GuitarFx): An open-source Arduino-based
   effects pedal designed for musical instruments. Leverages open-source
   hardware and software to craft unique audio effects. Developed a Software
   Development Kit (SDK) enabling users to create custom effects in C++14,
   utilizing [Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/),
   [Teensy](https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/) microcontrollers, and
   [PMod2](https://digilent.com/reference/pmod/pmodi2s2/start) I2S. Focused on
   innovation and accessibility to foster a creative community of musicians and
   developers.

5. [CheckWriter](https://github.com/ashafq/CheckWriter) is a modern GTK4‚Äêbased
   desktop application designed to simplify the process of writing/printing
   checks. Featuring an intuitive graphical interface, it allows users to input
   check details with ease, preview the layout in real time, and generate
   error‚Äêfree outputs. As the founder and original maintainer, I am responsible
   for the application‚Äôs architecture, development, and maintenance, ensuring
   cross‚Äêplatform compatibility and a user‚Äêcentric design.

6. [RtUtil](https://github.com/ashafq/rtutil): Maintain a free, cross‚Äêplatform,
   cli application for audio recording and playback. This project used `C++17`,
   `CMake`, `conan` C++ package manager, along with `rtaudio` for real‚Äêtime
   prortable audio I/O library.
