## Hello, World\n üëã

Ayan Shafqat is a motivated, curious, and creative engineer with many years of
experience in software development. Highly skilled in software engineering
principles, optimizing algorithms, embedded systems, digital signal processing,
and systems architecture. Shares a passion for music, systems software
development, exploring new programming languages, operating system kernel, and
high‚Äêperformance computing. Enjoys using libre and open‚Äêsource technologies and
occasionally takes part in their development.

## üî≠ Some of Ayan's work include:
1. [Ardour](https://ardour.org/): A libre Digital Audio Workstation (DAW),
   maintained by a diverse community ofdevelopers. Collaborated to optimize
   Ardour‚Äôs mix engine for Intel/AMD CPU with SSE, AVX, AVX512, and FMA
   extension. Also, optimized for ARMv8 and ARMv7 CPU with NEON extension.

2. [A57eq.lv2](https://github.com/ashafq/a5eq.lv2/): This an open-source LV2
   plugin featuring a high-performance 5-band equalizer, including a Low Shelf,
   three Peaking filters, and a High Shelf. Designed to assist both amateur and
   professional audio engineers, it supports precise sound sculpting across
   diverse tasks such as studio production, mastering, and live sound tweaking.

    What sets this equalizer apart is its meticulous core optimization. Leveraging
    Intel AVX2/FMA and SSE2 extensions (thoroughly tested on Intel‚Äôs 12th
    Generation Alder Lake) and NEON for ARM64/Aarch64 (tested on Apple M1), it
    delivers seamless and efficient performance. These optimizations achieve a 30%
    speed improvement over standard portable C++ code, translating to reduced power
    usage while maintaining superior audio quality.
   
3. [GuitarFx](https://github.com/ashafq/GuitarFx): An open source music
   instrument effects SDK (Contribute and sponsor!)

4. [RtUtil](https://github.com/ashafq/rtutil): Maintain a free, cross‚Äêplatform,
   cli application for audio recording and playback. This project used `C++17`,
   `CMake`, `conan` C++ package manager, along with `rtaudio` for real‚Äêtime
   prortable audio I/O library.
